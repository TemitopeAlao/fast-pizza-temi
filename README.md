# 🍕 Fast React Pizza (Course Project)

I built this project as part of my learning journey to practice **React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and API consumption**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Browse the pizza menu
- Add pizzas to a shopping cart
- Place an order with delivery details
- Priority orders option

- **React Router v6.4+** (routing, loaders, fetchers)
- **Redux Toolkit** (state management)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
- **Fetch API** (data fetching)

---

## 📚 What I Practiced & Learned

- Styling with **Tailwind CSS** and building responsive UIs
- Working with **React Router loaders and fetchers** to handle async data loading
- Using **path params** (e.g. `/order/:id`) vs **query params** (`/menu?sort=price`)
- Managing global state with **Redux Toolkit**
- Consuming APIs with **GET, POST, PATCH**, and handling errors
- Understanding the difference between frontend routes and backend API endpoints
